# Password Complexity Checker

This Python script assesses the strength of a password based on various criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

## Features

- Checks the length of the password.
- Verifies the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Validates the inclusion of numbers.
- Ensures the presence of special characters.
- Provides detailed feedback on the password's strength.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the `password_strength_checker.py` file.
2. Run the script using Python 3.
3. Enter a password when prompted.
4. Receive feedback on the strength of the password.

## Criteria for Password Strength

1. **Length**: Passwords should be at least 12 characters long for optimal security.
2. **Uppercase and Lowercase Letters**: Mixing uppercase and lowercase letters enhances security.
3. **Numbers**: Including numbers adds to the complexity of the password.
4. **Special Characters**: Special characters provide an extra layer of security.

## Regular Expression for Special Characters

A regular expression is used to efficiently check for the presence of special characters in the password.
